## **Top Two to Three Scenarios**

### **Your Scenario #1**

Meet Sarah, a vegan who is passionate about eating healthy and environmentally friendly meals. She’s always looking for creative vegan recipes, but her busy schedule as a Doctor prevents her from enjoying her time when planning her meals. One evening, Sarah returns home after a long day at work and realizes she only has a few ingredients in her fridge and pantry, so she isn’t sure what she can make out of it. She also doesn’t want to order takeout as she already did the last 3 nights. Frustrated, she decides to try out the Dish Thinker app/website. She enters what ingredients she has on hand, and within seconds, the app/site suggests a delicious and nutritious vegan dish tailored to her dietary preferences. Sarah is delighted with how convenient Dish Thinker is and ends up making a great vegan curry using the app/site provided recipe. It saves her time and ensures that she follows her dietary restrictions. 


### **Your Scenario #2**

Mark is a freshly graduated Engineering student who finds himself eating unhealthily and unprepared to plan/make actual meals by himself. Mark’s typical evening involves rushing home, working out, doing laundry, and then trying to figure out what to cook for dinner with the limited ingredients he has on hand. When he first moved into his own place, he found himself spending a lot of money on takeout and eating out. Tonight, he’s determined to use up some leftover chicken, vegetables, and pasta he found in the kitchen. Feeling overwhelmed, Mark decides to give Dish Thinker a shot. He inputs his ingredients into the app/site and almost instantly, it provides him with a recipe for a quick and delicious chicken pesto paste. Mark is impressed with how easy it was to find a suitable recipe that matches his available ingredients, saving him money, and ensuring that he enjoys a tasty meal without the stress of meal planning. 


### **Your Scenario #3**

John is a 17 year old high school student that wants to start learning how to cook. He’s excited about trying new recipes, but doesn’t want to break the bank buying ingredients. John simply inputs the available ingredients he has in his kitchen and Dish Thinker displays all the available recipes he can cook by buying less than 10$ worth of ingredients. Dish Thinker shows step-by-step instructions for each recipe, ensuring that a complete beginner like John can follow along and learn to cook a delicious meal all by himself.
